    <p>In the 1930s Universal Pictures continued producing films based on <em>Gothic Horror</em>. The studio entered a 
     Golden Age of monster movies in the '30s, releasing a string of hit horror movies. In this decade, the 
     studio assembled several <em>iconic monsters</em> in motion picture history including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracula" target="_blank">Dracula</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein" target="_blank">Frankenstein</a>, 
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mummy_(franchise)" target="_blank">The Mummy</a>, and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invisible_Man" target="_blank"> The Invisible Man</a>. Each movie starring these monsters would go on to make sequels 
     and each of the characters would go on to cross-over with one another in a cinematic shared universe. 
     The films would retroactively be classified together as part of the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Classic_Monsters" target="_blank">Universal Classic Monsters series.</a></p>

        <p><h4>Types of Horror</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><em><b>Body horror:</em></b> intentionally showcases graphic or psychologically disturbing violations of 
                human body. These violations may manifest through aberrant sex, mutations, mutilation, zombification, gratuitous violence, 
                disease, or unnatural movements of the body. It has roots in Gothic literature and has expanded to include
                other media. Famous body horror films include The Thing (1982), Videodrome (1983), The Fly (1986), 
                and Tetsuo: The Iron Man (1989)</li>
                <br>
            <li><em><b>Comedy horror:</b></em> combines elements of comedy and horror film. The comedy horror genre often crosses over with 
                the black comedy genre. It occasionally includes horror films with lower ratings that are aimed at a family audience. 
                The short story The Legend of Sleepy Hollow by Washington Irving is cited as "the first great comedy-horror story".</li>
                <br>
            <li><em><b>Folk horror:</b></em> typically includes a rural setting and themes of isolation, religion, the power of nature, and the potential
                darkness of rural landscapes.[167][168] Frequently cited examples are The White Reindeer (1952), Witchfinder General 
                (1968), The Blood on Satan's Claw (1971), The Wicker Man (1973), The Witch (2015) and Midsommar (2019).</li>
                <br>
            <li><em><b>Found footage horror:</b></em> "technique" gives the audience a first person view of the events on screen, and 
                presents the footage as being discovered after. Horror films which are framed as being made up of "found-footage" 
                merge the experiences of the audience and characters, which may induce suspense, shock, and bafflement. 
                Examples of first-person horror include Nightcall, The Blair Witch Project (1999), Noroi: The Curse (2005),
                Paranormal Activity (2007), Cloverfield (2008), and Devil's Due (2014).</li>

                I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997).</li>
